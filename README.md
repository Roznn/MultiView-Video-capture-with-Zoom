DIY Computer Vision at Home -  multiple view video capture using Zoom


Using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) software for videotelephony, a meeting can be accessed with multiple devices 
and the session can be recorded by the host device (screen capture). When a single participant connect with multiple devices in the online zoom meeting, 
the recording of the meeting provides one video (mp4, 1280 x 720 at 25fps) with  multiple view capture of the participant. 
A downsample example is shown below: the recording was done using 4 devices:  PC (windows 10, wired broadband, host recording the meeting) 
and 3 wirelss devices (ipad + android smartphone + windows laptop).
